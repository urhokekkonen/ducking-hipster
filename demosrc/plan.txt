TODO: modify top of screen each line of copperlist



allocate memory in chipram for copperlist:

start portion:
3 bitplanes, sprites off, blitter dma on

start line 50:
left color set;
wait horizontal X;
mid color set;
wait horizontal X2;
left color set;
wait next line

repeat x 312 lines

7 longwords by 312 + some start + some end; so about 9200 bytes
